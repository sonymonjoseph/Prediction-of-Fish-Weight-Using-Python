This project analyzes a dataset of 60 observations and 6 variables to determine the most effective model for predicting changes in students’ standardized scores after training. The models compared include Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network. Key steps include visual analysis through correlation heatmaps and pair plots, evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports, and a recommendation of the best-performing model. Finally, two enhancements are proposed to improve the selected model’s usability and performance.
